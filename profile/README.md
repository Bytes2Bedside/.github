## Hi there 👋
Repo for storing Bytes2Bedside Collaborative Coding Items Background: 
Bytes2Bedside is a collaborative grant focused on evaluating decision support outcomes related to 8 use cases1 within 6 health systems2. This is a 3-year grant period (2024-2026), with the potential to expand an additional 2 years and at least 4 sites. 
We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of decision support (Alerts and Order Sets) across all 6 sites, while creating a dashboard to determine if one process performs better than another.

One of the primary aims of the grant is to determine any efficiency gains that can be made via a collaborative coding process. 
Each site will be randomized to work collaboratively with 2 other sites on various use cases, while individual sites will be responsible for developing code for use cases that site is solely responsible for.

Processes:

Track time spent on project using MyHours – separated by each use case
We will be using GitHub as the code repository. 
a. Sole Organization code should be saved to your specific folder 
b. Collaborative code will be saved to a separate folder, with branches to account for version control of any necessary updates 
c. Will also keep note of any process updates specific to each organization

Monthly meetings will be used to update status of each organization a. Will not discuss any barriers or facilitators to keep any biases neutral
